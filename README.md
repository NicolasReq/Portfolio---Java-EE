# Portfolio---Java-EE

Here are some classes from a 3 month project. I made a "log consulting" web application for a software company and the mission was a success. 
For this project, I used Java EE, Apache Velocity, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery and Ajax.
You can find a description of the code at the beginning of each class.
